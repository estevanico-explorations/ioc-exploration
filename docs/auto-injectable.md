# Auto Injected Functions & Files

Would it be possible, or even make sense, to do automatic `IoC` dependency injection? What does that look like? Do I need to write custom linting plugins? Do I need custom bundlers? Not sure.

How can I pass down dependencies downstream automatically or invisibly?
